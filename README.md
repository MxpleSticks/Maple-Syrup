## Setting Up Visual Studio for C++

This guide will help you download Visual Studio, install the Desktop Development with C++ package, create a new C++ project, and add ASCII animation code.

### Step 1: Download and Install Visual Studio
1. Go to the [Visual Studio download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
2. Choose the **Community** version (free) and download it.
3. Run the installer.

### Step 2: Install Desktop Development with C++
1. In the Visual Studio installer, under **Workloads**, select **Desktop development with C++**.
2. Click **Install**. This will install the necessary C++ tools and libraries for building and running C++ programs.

### Step 3: Create a New C++ Project
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to **File > New > Project**.
3. In the project templates, select **Console App** under **C++**.
4. Name your project (e.g., `AsciiAnimationProject`) and click **Create**.

### Step 4: Copy and Paste the Animation Code
1. Visit the GitHub page for the ASCII animation you want to use (e.g., `spinning_donut.cpp`).
2. Copy the code.
3. In Visual Studio, open the `main.cpp` file that was generated with your project.
4. Delete any existing code in `main.cpp` and paste in the animation code.

### Step 5: Build and Run the Program
1. In the top menu, click **Build > Build Solution** to compile your project.
2. After it builds successfully, click **Debug > Start Without Debugging** (or press `Ctrl + F5`) to run the program.

If you followed the steps correctly, your ASCII animation should display in the terminal window!

## Usage

### Example Animation: Spinning ASCII Donut

1. Copy the spinning donut code from `spinning_donut.cpp`.
2. Paste it into `main.cpp`.
3. Build and run as described above, and youâ€™ll see the animation in action!

## Available Animations

- **Spinning Donut:** A mesmerizing rotating 3D donut made with ASCII characters
- **Cube:** A fun little spinning cube
- **Fractal Formula:** A formula calculated to ascii form
- **Rain:** Simulates a raining effect for text
- **Spiral:** A looping spiral animation

Check out each animation on the GitHub page and simply copy the one you like!

## Customization

Each animation is designed to be easy to tweak. You can:
- **Adjust Timing:** Change the frame delay to speed up or slow down the animation.
- **Set Loop Count:** Define the number of repetitions.
- **Edit Frames:** Modify frames directly in the file for custom effects.
